## Notes

- __20 May 2020 - 6 June 2020:__ Issues scraping data due to Schema.org changing the way they serve the JSON-LD context file. Workaround put in place on 5 June 2020.

Please note that the markup scraping has been moved to one of our servers and for the time being there is not direct public access, please come in touch with us if you need access to the scraped content.
